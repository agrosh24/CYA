You sit there for hours… and hours… and hours. You can’t tell how long it’s been, as there isn’t any way to tell the time in the cave. You haven’t slept or drank anything (there wasn’t any water in the tea set), and the two carrots barely helped. You threw your bag towards the center of the room when you stooped down to look inside the lockbox, and it’s too far away to reach from where you are. The safe is stuck to the floor. You cannot move it no matter how hard you try.
