“…Shit. I must have lost my wallet somewhere. It was a nice wallet too, like damn. Hey, can you do me a favor? If you help me retrace my steps, I can give you the money in my wallet (it’s 30 money, so it’s a good starting off for you, but it’s not a world ender for me. would be a good reward for getting my wallet back, it’s sentimental to me)".
