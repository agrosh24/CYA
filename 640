“I, Bogington the First, am putting this treasure down in this ancient cavern to hide it from the world. It is of a great evil: the weapon that started the Great War. My careless use of it triggered the invasion of our kingdom, bringing about the death of many, many people. I have used all but one of the charges since I brought it from my land. Whoever finds it, use it wisely.”
