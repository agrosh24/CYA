You return to Bogeytown to claim your 1 million gold from the Adventurer’s Guild. You head to the castle, telling Sir Bogey the good news and showing him the vial. After much negotiation and bureaucracy, Sir Bogey leaves the castle to you, ready to switch places and explore the modern world. You spend your million on renovating the town and setting up sustainable sources of income for the country; it’s a great success. Prosperity returns to the town, and it enters a golden age once more. Oh, you also renamed it in honor of the friend who helped you get started in this world.
GRUNKLETOWN ENDING.
