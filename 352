“THE BUTTON IS A DEAD MAN’S SWITCH. IF YOU LET GO, YOU WILL EXPLODE. Hah! Tricked you. You thought you could steal my treasure, huh? Think again. Now now, I forgive you. Everyone is desperate in these hard times, and I myself am no stranger to a bit of petty theft. Look. If you managed to get this far, that means I’m probably out shopping. I’ll come back later in the day and deactivate the trap. Of course, I’ll bring the village guard with me, and they’ll send you to the local jail, but it’s far better than being blown up, no?”
