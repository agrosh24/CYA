You take out your wedge, carefully aim, and fire. Like, you shoot fire. And it completely misses Dave. The stand bursts aflame. The man at the stand yells blood curdling screams, and Dave’s rope is out of reach of the flame. He’s probably going to choke or burn to death before the rope gets loose. Good one.
