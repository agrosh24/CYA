It’s surprisingly hard to find a hiding place. You don’t have a shovel, and you can’t just leave them under a tree somewhere. You drag Grunkledorf until you find a river, tie his bag to his chest, and fill the bag with rocks. You toss him into the river, and to your horror, he is floating. You stamp down on him several times to get him to submerge.
You’re a horrible person.
