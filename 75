You stroll into town with Grunkledorf. It’s a quaint little village, vaguely medieval, but nice. You enter a little circular marketplace with a few different types of stores, all connected by a neat cobblestone pathway. In the center is a public gathering place. It looks like they’re hanging someone. Fun.
