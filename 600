You get by through quests, and slowly rise through the ranks of the Adventurer’s Guild. An arrow to the knee cuts your practice short, though, and you settle down, starting a lovely family. You build a house on the river on the outskirts of town, watching your children grow old. Maybe life isn’t so bad after all.
SETTLE DOWN ENDING.
