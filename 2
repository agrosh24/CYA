Putter - Ah, the classic. You’ve had this thing for years. Effective AND silent. You’ve snuck up and swung this at the back of multiple people’s heads before (they probably deserved it).
(Sneak)
Driver - Can’t say you’re really good at this one. Well, you’re not really good with ANY of the clubs, but it feels like the wind always plays against you when you use it. Remember the time you were using it to take potshots at the neighbor’s window from like a hundred feet away? Good times.
(Ranged)
Iron - Battered. Well worn. Hasn’t actually touched a golf ball yet, but it’s really good at defending from home invaders. Or bar fights. 
(Melee)
Wedge - How the fuck does this thing even work? You hit it… and the ball goes up? What? You could even say it’s…
(Magic)
