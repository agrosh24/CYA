“When I was a young lad, this was a small village, only recently founded by Sir Bogey’s grandfather, Lord Bogus Bogington the First. If you weren’t aware, the modern Sir Bogey’s full title is ‘Sir Bogus Bogington the Third’, but we call him Sir Bogey for short. Bogington the First had appeared out of nowhere, carrying four long, thin metal bars to defend himself.”
