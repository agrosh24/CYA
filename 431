“Ah, right. Got a little ahead of myself. See, we used to be part of a great kingdom by the name of Hohenbohen. About 25 years ago, a great war broke out between our kingdom and its rival, Bobenhoben. The Bobenhobish king heard that the Hohenbohens possessed a weapon of great power, one that could instantly kill anyone. No magic nor armor could stop it. And thus, they declared war, hoping to take it for themselves. The two kingdoms fought and fought for 7 years, throwing every last man at each other. Eventually, they both ran out of resources and collapsed. Bogeytown was relatively spared by the fighting, but many of our richer merchants fled to more protected cities, and many of our adventurers died looking for spoils of war. Nowadays, we are independent, but we miss the prosperity of the good old days.”
