You are but a humble fellow, looking to play some golf with your pals. Well, I say humble, but golf players are never humble. Golf sucks. You suck. Anyway, you hit up the range with some friends. In front of you is a wide open field, and at your disposal hundreds of golf balls that the underpaid workers will go fetch for you once you finish. You pull out of your bag 4 types of golf club. What do you want to practice today?
