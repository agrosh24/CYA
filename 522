You basically haven’t gotten anywhere. You’re like 3 stories up. You look towards the door on the right: it says “Storage”. You climb up a flight of stairs. Another door that says “Storage”. You take a golf club out of your bag and put it in front of the door. Then, you climb up another flight of stairs. The golf club is still there. This fucker.
