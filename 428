“Well, consider it. Anyways, where was I? Oh yes. Bogington the First had always talked about being from a distant, distant land, much unlike ours. He was a strange sort, always muttering something about ‘that stupid caddie’. He was very smart, though. His ideas (like steam power and the shoelace) were revolutionary, and they made him very wealthy. Once he built up enough money, he began his life work: constructing this town.”
