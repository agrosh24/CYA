Hitting Dave square in the head. It cuts into his forehead, and his sounds of choking turn into gurgling screams. Crowd members look back at you in shock for a few seconds, and then begin cheering. People take out various objects from their bags and start throwing them at him. An apple falls short from Dave’s feet. A beer bottle explodes on his chest. A wooden beam thrown like a spear jams into his legs. Dave continues to choke to death in front of everyone, now being used as a dart board. You want to try again, but you’re in shock, and the commotion of the crowd makes it hard to focus. You give up.
